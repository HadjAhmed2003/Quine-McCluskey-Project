Project Manual :
https://github.com/HadjAhmed2003/Quine-McCluskey-Project.git


This application is designed to simplify boolean expressions using the Quine-McCluskey algorithm. The algorithm works by comparing pairs of terms and combining those that differ by only one variable. This process is repeated until no further simplification can be made.
To use this application, follow the steps below:


1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the following command to build the application:on
g++ -o quine-mccluskey quine-mccluskey.cpp
4. Once the application is compiled, run the following command to start the program:
./quine-mccluskey
5. The program will prompt the user to input the terms of the boolean expression as a sum of product form. Each product term should be separated by a “+” sign For example:
6. Enter the terms of the boolean expression: abc+b’cd
 
7. After entering the terms, the program will simplify the expression using the Quine-McCluskey algorithm and display the simplified result.
Thank you for using this application.
